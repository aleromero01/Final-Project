            <h1>What is it?</h1><br>
            This 31-day challenge was created by five high school students who want to help you help your environment.
            By doing small actions everyday, you get to make a big change for the planet and all animals, plants, and
            people that live in it. In today's age of technology, it is more than essential to be conscious about
            how our actions impact our surroundings, and about how we can reduce this impact through the use of technology.
            Join the challenge, and make a change! <p>

          <img src="climatechange.jpg" style="height:200px; float:left; margin:10px; border-radius:5px;"/>
          Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.
          And experts see the trend is accelerating: All but one of the 16 hottest years in NASA’s 134-year record have
          occurred since 2000. Scientists say that unless we curb global-warming emissions, average U.S. temperatures
          could increase by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. Global warming occurs when carbon
          dioxide and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the
          atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface.
          Normally, this radiation would escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to
          centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the
          greenhouse effect.

          <ul>
            <li>Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic water shortages and increase the risk of wildfires in the American West.</li>
            <li>Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern Seaboard, especially in Florida, and in other areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
            <li>Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy downpours, and increased flooding. All those factors will damage or destroy agriculture and fisheries.</li>
            <img src="climatechange2.jpg" style="height:200px; float:right; margin:10px; border-radius:5px;"/>
            <li>Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many plant and animal species to extinction.</li>
            <li>Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common due to increased growth of pollen-producing ragweed, higher levels of air pollution, and the spread of conditions favorable to pathogens and mosquitoes.</li>
